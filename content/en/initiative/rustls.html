<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>
    Most devices on the Internet use the TLS protocol to protect their data in transit. Unfortunately, most TLS implementations are written in C and have a long history of memory safety vulnerabilities.
</p>

<p>
    It's important for the security of the Internet that we move away from TLS libraries that aren't memory safe. Since 2021 we've invested heavily in a memory safe implementation of TLS called <a href="https://github.com/rustls/rustls">Rustls</a>. Today, not only is Rustls memory safe, it's fully featured while <a href="https://www.memorysafety.org/blog/rustls-server-perf/">significantly faster and more efficient</a> than most other TLS implementations.
</p>

<p>
    While Rustls is popular in the Rust community, we work hard to make sure it is easy to use from existing C and C++ programs. In addition to the native Rust API, Rustls has a <a href="https://github.com/rustls/rustls-ffi">C API</a> and an <a href="https://github.com/rustls/rustls-openssl-compat">OpenSSL compatibility layer</a>. For some projects, Rustls can act as a drop-in replacement for OpenSSL.
</p>

<h2>What We've Done</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Dirkjan Ochtman via contract with Prossimo, March 2021 through October 2021.</li>
  <li>ISRG engineer Jacob Hoffman-Andrews developed a <a href="https://github.com/rustls/rustls-ffi">C API for Rustls</a> that existing C-based projects can use to make their TLS implementation memory safe.</li>
  <li>Joe Birr-Pixton via contract with Prossimo, December 2022 through January 2023.</li>
  <li>Ferrous Systems worked on a no-allocation API, no_std compatibility, and async APIs via contract with Prossimo, June 2023 through December 2023.</li>
  <li>Adolfo Ochogavía improved performance benchmarking via contract with Prossimo, August 2023 through December 2023.</li>
  <li>Daniel McCarney worked full time on Rustls via a contract with Prossimo, March 2023 through December 2024.</li>
  <li>Joe Birr-Pixton worked full time on Rustls via a contract with Prossimo, June 2023 through December 2024.</li>
  <li>Joe Birr-Pixton worked part time on Rustls via a contract with Prossimo, January 2025 through March 2025.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The Rustls community has grown quite a bit over the past few years and it's great to see the work happening outside of our investments!
</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Joe Birr-Pixton is currently working full time on Rustls via a contract with Prossimo, March 2025 through March 2026. An optimized and stable API, additional performance improvements, and better OpenSSL compatibility are priorities.</li>
  <li>Dirkjan Ochtman is currently working on Rustls part-time via a contract with Prossimo, March 2025 through March 2026, with the same priorities as Joe.</li>
