<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>
  zlib is a data compression library that has been around since 1995. It's quite useful and as a result it's widely used. Unfortunately it has a history of memory safety vulnerabilities, a common phenomenon for compression libraries written in C/C++.
</p>

<p>
  We would like to see a high performance implementation of zlib in Rust. We'd like it to have both a Rust API and a C API that's compatible with the C version of zlib so that existing C/C++ programs can use a safer version of zlib.
</p>

<h2>What We've Done</h2>

<p>
  We contracted with <a href="https://tweedegolf.nl/">Tweede golf</a> in December of 2023 for an <a href="https://github.com/memorysafety/zlib-rs/">initial implementation</a> based on <a href="https://github.com/zlib-ng/zlib-ng">zlib-ng</a>, with a focus on maintaining excellent performance while introducing memory safety.
</p>

<p>
  Tweede golf did a great job with the initial implemenation of zlib-rs under contract with ISRG, then they really ran with it and turned it into a more mature piece of software. It made a lot of sense to <a href="https://www.memorysafety.org/blog/zlib-to-trifecta-tech/">turn the project over</a> to their associated <a href="https://trifectatech.org/">Trifecta Tech Foundation</a> in November of 2024.
</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>
  Prossimo's involvement with zlib-rs is largely complete, but we will continue to support Trifecta Tech Foundation's efforts by helping with audits and keeping an eye out for funding.
