<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://curl.se/">Curl</a> is a ubiquitous network transfer utility. It's on desktops, laptops, servers, vehicles, and appliances. Securing curl is
  important because its primary job is to handle data coming in from a network. Unfortunately, all of the networking code in curl is written in C, which is not
  memory safe.
</p>

<p>
  We got in touch with curl's maintainer, Daniel Stenberg, to talk about how we might help protect curl's core HTTP and TLS networking code from memory safety
  vulnerabilities. Daniel had a lot of great questions about what we had in mind, and he patiently answered a lot our questions. We quickly realized we were
  talking to a thoughtful, cautiously progressive maintainer. He was willing to hear us out and consider significant changes, but he would need a plan that was
  not overly disruptive to existing users.
</p>

<p>
  Together, we came up with a plan to add options to build curl with memory-safe HTTP and TLS libraries. For HTTP we chose the
  <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper">Hyper</a> library. For TLS we chose the <a href="https://github.com/ctz/rustls">Rustls</a> library. We contracted
  with Daniel to work on the Hyper library integration, while ISRG engineer Jacob Hoffman-Andrew worked on the Rustls integration.
</p>

<p>
  Today curl users can choose to build curl with Hyper and Rustls. Work is being done to make sure full testing is in place to set these new options up for
  stability and success over the long run.
