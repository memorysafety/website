<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>
  The sudo and su utilities mediate a critical privilege boundary on just about every open source operating system that powers the Internet. Unfortunately, these utilities have a long history of memory safety issues.
</p>

<p>
  By rewriting sudo and su in Rust we can make sure they don't suffer from any more memory safety vulnerabilities. By leaving out infrequently used features we can reduce attack surface.
</p>

<h2>What We've Done</h2>

<p>
  In December of 2022 we funded a joint development effort between <a href="https://tweedegolf.nl/">Tweede Golf</a> and <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/">Ferrous Systems</a> to rewrite sudo and su in Rust.
</p>

<p>
  As of August 2023, the first <a href="https://www.memorysafety.org/blog/sudo-first-stable-release/">stable release</a> is out, give it a shot!
</p>

<p>
  In June of 2024 the sudo-rs project graduated to a new long-term home at <a href="https://trifectatech.org/">Trifecta Tech Foundation</a>. We believe they'll do a great job stewarding the project going forward.
</p>

<p>
  We'd like to thank Todd Miller, maintainer of the original sudo utility, for his advice and guidance regarding implementing sudo-rs.
</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>
  Prossimo's work on sudo-rs is complete. <a href="https://trifectatech.org/">Trifecta Tech Foundation</a> is taking it from here!
</p>

<p>
  We were excited to learn in May of 2025 that <a href="https://trifectatech.org/blog/memory-safe-sudo-to-become-the-default-in-ubuntu/">sudo-rs will become the default sudo implementation in Ubuntu</a>.
