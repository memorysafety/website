<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>
  Media decoders have historically been fertile ground for memory safety vulnerabilities. This is because they are complex, heavily used, and commonly processing untrusted data from networks.
</p>

<p>
  AV1 is set to become one of the most important media formats on the Internet. As it becomes more widely used, we want people to have access to a decoder that is as memory safe as reasonably possible while delivering great performance. No such decoder exists today. We are building one.
</p>

<h2>What We've Done</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We engaged the team at <a href="https://immunant.com/">Immunant</a> as well as veteran media codec expert Frank Bossen to work on our decoder, named <a href="https://github.com/memorysafety/rav1d">rav1d</a>. Work started on March 1, 2023.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/memorysafety/rav1d/releases/tag/v1.0.0">Version 1.0.0</a> was released on July 19, 2024.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/memorysafety/rav1d/releases/tag/v1.1.0">Version 1.1.0</a> was released on May 6, 2025. This synchronizes rav1d code with the latest version of dav1d, v1.5.1.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>
  rav1d is fully functional (we even have it working in Chromium), but it's about 5% slower than dav1d. We need it to be at least as fast as dav1d. We've engaged contractors to work on performance and now we are <a href="https://www.memorysafety.org/blog/rav1d-perf-bounty/">offering a bounty</a>.
