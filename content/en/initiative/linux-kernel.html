<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>The Linux kernel is at the heart of today's Internet. Unfortunately, because it's written in C, it has a long history of memory safety vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>
  Securing the Linux kernel is imperative if we want a secure Internet. One of the best ways we can do that is by making it possible to write Linux kernel modules (e.g. drivers) in a memory safe language. To be honest, when we first starting thinking about how to bring memory safety to the Linux kernel, the problem seemed intractable.
</p>

<p>
  Then we learned that about the <a href="https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux">Rust for Linux</a> project. Miguel Ojeda and Alex Gaynor have done incredible work, both technically and in terms of making the case for Rust in the Linux kernel.
</p>

<h2>What We've Done</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Miguel Ojeda was initially funded to work on Rust for Linux full time from April 2021 through April 2022. Miguel's contract was renewed for April 2022 through April 2023.</li>
  <li>Gary Guo was funded to work part time on Rust compiler features and tools needed to support Rust in the Linux kernel between October 2022 and February 2023.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Rust support has been <a href="https://www.memorysafety.org/blog/rust-in-linux-just-the-beginning/">merged into the Linux kernel</a>!
</p>

<p>
  See the links below for getting up to speed on this work.
</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>
  Miguel is making great progress.
</p>

<p>
  We're hoping to support getting some of the first production-ready drivers written in Rust into the kernel, perhaps starting with an NVMe driver.
