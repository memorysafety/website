<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>
  Keeping track of time is critical for servers and clients on the Internet. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol">NTP</a> is how the Internet keeps track of time. Since NTP implementations are so critical and they're on the network, it's important that they be secure.
</p>

<p>
  The most popular NTP implementations today are written in C and are not memory safe. We're aiming to fix that.
</p>

<h2>What We've Done</h2>

<p>
  During 2022 Prossimo contracted <a href="https://tweedegolf.nl/en">Tweede golf</a> to implement NTP in Rust. The new implementation was called <a href="https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs">ntpd-rs</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Work on the client, server, and <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2020/08/everything-you-need-to-know-about-network-time-security/">NTS</a> support is complete and ready for production deployment.
</p>

<p>
  A third party security audit performed by <a href="https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/">Radically Open Security</a> was <a href="https://tweedegolf.nl/en/blog/94/report-ntp-security-audit">completed</a>.
</p>

<p>
  In April of 2023 Tweede golf's associated <a href="https://trifectatech.org/">Trifecta Tech Foundation</a> became the new home for ntpd-rs. We thank them for all of their great work!
</p>

<p>
  Today ntpd-rs is a mature implementation and we encourage anyone interested to try it out. It's currently deployed in a number of places, including at the <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> certificate authority.
</p>
